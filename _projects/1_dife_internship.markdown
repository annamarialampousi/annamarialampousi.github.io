In 2016, I moved to Berlin, Germany where I did a 6-month internship as part of my bachelor studies, with the support of the Erasmus+ exchange program. During that period, I joined Professor Heiner Boeingâ€™s group at the [German Institute of Human Nutrition](https://www.dife.de/en/){:target="\_blank"}, department of Epidemiology.
The internship provided me with hands on experience in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses in the field of nutritional epidemiology and resulted in the publication of three articles in the field. More specifically, I got familiar with research synthesis and data extraction methods, calculation of dietary intakes, risk of bias assessment, and application of relevant statistical software. Moreover, I was involved in the preparation of materials and the administrative management of the International Summer School in Nutritional Epidemiology (8th-19th August 2016), in which I also participated, organized by the department of Epidemiology. This experience determined the next steps of my education and was the start of a very exciting journey in the world of epidemiology.
