In July 2019 I visited Hanoi, Vietnam and joined the scientific work of the Micronutrient department at the [National Institute of Nutrition](http://viendinhduong.vn/vi/hop-tac-quoc-te/national-institute-of-nutrition-159.html){:target="\_blank"}. Among my tasks was to compare the effects of different dietary interventions on the growth and disease status of Vietnamese children. In parallel, I was a volunteer teacher at one of the many schools in the country whose goal is to offer free English courses to everyone.
